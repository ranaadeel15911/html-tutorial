    <h1> Diffrence Between URL and Domain :</h1>
    <br>
    <b>A URL is (Uniform Resource locator) The web address which found at the top of website which is also call adress
        bar <br><br> <b>For example</b><br> <br>Http//www.google.com <br><br>Domain shows organization as we can see in

    <h1>Relative Link :</h1>
<h3>
    only one thing which is important to link a file is suppose you opened a file in a folder if you wants to get back from file and in present folder thanyou will write one dot and forward slash than you will get suggestion of present folder files <p>e.g like ./ </p>and if you wants to get back from present folder than write as <p>../ </p>means to get back from opened file of html css js than will write ./ and we will suggestions of present folder files and if we wants get back from folder than ../ will work
</h3>
<h1>Absolute path</h1>
<span>The path by which we picked image link and used in website in simple picked the image from google </span>
<h1>Relative path</h1>
<span>The path in your laptop by which you picked image</span>
    <pre> <h2> Same Folder </h2>
To link to a file in the same folder, just use the file 
name. (Nothing else is needed.) e.g To link to music reviews from the music homepage:
 <h3> &lt a href="reviews.html"&gt Reviews &lt /a &gt  </h3>
<h2> Child Folder </h2>
For a child folder, use the name of the child folder, 
followed by a forward slash, then the file name. e.g To link to music listings from the homepage:
<h3> &lt; a href="music/listings.html" &gt; Listings &lt; /a &gt; </h3>
<h2> Grandchild Folder </h2> 
Use the name of the child folder, followed by a 
forward slash, then the name of the grandchild 
folder, followed by another forward slash, then the 
file name. To link to DVD reviews from the homepage:
<h3> &lt; a href="movies/dvd/reviews.html" &gt; </h3>
Reviews &lt; /a &gt;
<h2> Parent Folder </h2>
Use ../ to indicate the folder above the current one, 
then follow it with the file name.To link to the homepage from the music reviews:
<h3> &lt; a href="../index.html" &gt; Home &lt /a &gt; </h3>
<h2> GrandParent Folder </h2>
Repeat the ../ to indicate that you want to go up 
two folders (rather than one), then follow it with the 
file name.To link to the homepage from the DVD reviews:
<h3> &lt a href="../../index.html" &gt Home &lt; /a &gt; </h3>
</pre>
    <h2>Now We Will Link To GrandFAther File And Other</h2>
    <a href="../Parent.html">Parent</a> <br>
    <a href="../../GrandParent.html">GrandParent</a> <br>
    <a href="../../../Father Of Grand.html">Father Of Grand</a> <br>
    <a href="#adeel.html">Hesh</a>
    <p>Sometime it not works in live server so we can directly run from folder</p>
    <br><i>Here We Can Say &ThinSpace; &ThinSpace; ../ &ThinSpace; Mean Back From Present Folder In Which Index File Is
        Place And &ThinSpace; &ThinSpace; ../../ &ThinSpace; Mean Double Back From Present Folder Nd So On...</i>
    <h1>Target ="_Blank" :</h1>
    <br><i>To Open Link In A new window we use it</i>
    &lt; a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank" &gt;
    Internet Movie Database &lt; /a &gt; (opens in new window)

    <h3>Drop Down list :</h3>
    <p>Radio button used to select less number of option but when there is many option then drop down list is better to
        work</p>
<h3>Drop Down List In group Form And Disable Attribute :</h3>
<b>Which laptop you wants to buy</b> <br>
<select name="Laptop" id="" size="5" >
    <optgroup label="Dell Laptop">
<option value=""label="13 pro" disabled></option>

<option value="14" label="17 pro max"></option>t
<option value="15" label="18 ultra pro max"></option>
    </optgroup>
</select>
<p>We can also define size as we defined size="3" and we can see 3 element in <b>We can define label attribute inside the derop down option and optiongrp which act like placeholder in drop down list  and by it we can select a option easily</b></p>
        <h3>Label Tag :</h3>
    <p>Label tag use because usually mobile screen has small vision and to select a input box we select input box
        carefully but by using label tag if we touch on text input box will be select <b>For Example</b></p>
    <form action="Hesh.html" method="get">
        <label >Age  <input type="text" name="age" /> </label>
        <input type="submit" value="submit">
    </form>
    <p>Here if we touch Age then input box will also select except touching input box.<b>The whole Age and input box will be in label tag The Label tag will work</b></p>
    <h3>for Tag in Label :</h3>
    <p>In it we define id of a input box to which when we touch this word in label tag the box will be open or star writing to which we gave this id</p>
<h4 >For Example</h4>
<form action="Hesh.html" method="get">
    <p>Select Gender</p>
    <label for="female">Female</label>  <input type="text" name="Female" id="female" /> 
    <label for="male">Male</label>  <input type="text" name="Male" id="male"/> 
    <input type="submit" value="submit">
</form>
<p>This is classic and professional way to <b>Apply Label Tag sorround a word not to whole input and word and then define id in the input and by mentioning id in label tag in for attribute we can use it.</b></p>
<h4>Another Example</h4>
<form action="Hesh.html" method="get">
    <p>Select Gender</p>
    <label for="Shemale">Shemale</label>  <input type="text" name="Female" id="Ladyboy" /> 
    <label for="Ladyboy">Ladyboy</label>  <input type="text" name="Male" id="Shemale"/> 
    <input type="submit" value="submit">
</form>
<p><b>we can see that we click on Shemale but box of LAdyboy open because we mentioned Ladyboy id in Shemale </b></p>
<h3>&lt;input Required = "Required"&gt; :</h3>

        <h1>Comments : </h1>
        <h3> To comment in html it mean that words or lines who used for ddetail not for showing in hml or browser </h3>
        <br><br>
        <b>"The short cut key to comment in html is ctrl + k + C And Shift + Alt + A"</b>
        <h1>ID Tag :</h1>
        <b>Every HTML element can carry
            the id attribute. It is used to
            uniquely identify that element
            from other elements on the
            page. Its value should start with
            a letter or an underscore (not a
            number or any other character).
            It is important that no two
            elements on the same page
            have the same value for their id
            attributes (otherwise the value is
            no longer unique)</b>

        <h1> Class Tag :</h1>
        <b>Every HTML element can
            also carry a class attribute.
            Sometimes, rather than uniquely
            identifying one element within
            a document, you will want a
            way to identify several elements
            as being different from the
            other elements on the page.
            For example, you might have
            some paragraphs of text that
            contain information that is more
            important than others and want
            to distinguish these elements, or
            you might want to differentiate
            between links that point to other
            pages on your own site and links
            that point to external sites.</b>
        <h1>Block Level elements :</h1>
        <b>Some elements will always
            appear to start on a new line in
            the browser window. These are
            known as block level elements.
            Examples of block elements are
            &lt; h1 &gt &lt; p &gt &lt; ul &gt and &lt; li &gt;</b>

        <h1>Inline element :</h1>
        <b>Some elements will always
            appear to continue on the
            same line as their neighbouring
            elements. These are known as
            inline elements.
            Examples of inline elements are
            &lt; a &gt,&lt; b &gt, &lt; em &gt, and &lt img &gt</b>
        <h1>DIV tag :</h1>
        <b>The div element allows you to
            group a set of elements together
            in one block-level box.
            For example, you might create
            a div element to contain all
            of the elements for the header
            of your site (the logo and the
            navigation), or you might create
            a div element to contain
            comments from visitors.
            In a browser, the contents of
            the div element will start on
            a new line, but other than this
            it will make no difference to the
            presentation of the page.</b><p>An important thing to note in ths is to fit content in the div or image fit in the div got by 100% to image element in div will increase its size according to its parent element that is div </p>

        <b> none </b>
